# I Taught GIT to High School Students

This blog post is not about a new technology or an hot tech trend that you would hear of nowadays, it's about my experience as **Mentor** for High School students.

# When & how I decided to teach GIT to high school students? 
It all started when [Exo Italia](https://www.exoitalia.it/) decided to organize a Linux Day here in Latina.

Since I am the founder & one of the admins of [Latina In Tech](https://www.latinaintech.org/), a local community of tech professionals in Latina, we were selected as partners for this initiative and we were so excited to take part into this! 


So we gladly accepted to collaborate with Exo, [Latina LUG](https://www.latinalug.it/) (which is a Linux User Group based in Latina) and [Open Hub Lazio](https://openhublazio.it/), which was the location choosed to host this event.

We as a community are really focused on knowledge sharing, and this was a perfect opportunity for us to get involved in sharing things, and it was also a great way to get in touch with young techies like we were a long time ago. ðŸ˜‰


The topic of my presentation was quite random, because initially it was another guy who proposed to speak about GIT, and I proposed myself to help him writing down the slides and be his substitute if he had trouble coming that day.


I must say that helping him out preparing the slides made me feel like I really wanted to take part in that event as presenter! As luck would have it, Lorenzo (this was the other guy's name) told me he wouldn't have been at the in-person event, because he did have an unforeseen on his agenda.
